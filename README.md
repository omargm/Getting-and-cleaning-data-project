# Getting-and-cleaning-data-project
Coursera Getting and Cleaning data project.

This is my project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

The R script I have done does the following steps.

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Load the activity 
3. Load the feature
3. Loads both the training and test datasets, and keeps  columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
5. Merges the two datasets
6. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.


The final result is shown in the file tidy.txt
